Whether it\'s monitoring IoT sensors, tracking user behavior, or processing financial transactions, the ability to query fresh data immediately is critical. However, building a streaming analytics pipeline traditionally requires managing complex infrastructure and dealing with data format conversions.\\n\\nThis solution shows how to build a serverless real-time streaming analytics pipeline using [Amazon S3 Tables](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/tables/) and [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/). By combining streaming ingestion with Apache Iceberg\'s analytics-optimized format, you can query data within minutes of generation\u2014without managing any servers or data transformation jobs.\\n\\n**GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/manu-mishra/s3table-firehose-lambda-terraform-demo](https://github.com/manu-mishra/s3table-firehose-lambda-terraform-demo)\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## Architecture Overview\\n\\nThe solution creates an end-to-end streaming analytics pipeline that generates IoT sensor data using [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), simulating 10 sensors across multiple locations. Data streams continuously through Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose with automatic buffering and delivery, then gets stored in Apache Iceberg format using Amazon S3 Tables for optimized analytics performance. The solution integrates with [AWS Lake Formation](https://aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/) for centralized data governance and access control.\\n\\nThe solution generates approximately **600,000 records per hour** from simulated IoT sensors, demonstrating real-world streaming data patterns for temperature, humidity, and pressure monitoring across warehouse and office locations.\\n\\n## Key Components\\n\\n### Data Generation Layer\\n\\n**AWS Lambda** (512 MB memory) generates 10,000 IoT sensor records per invocation at a rate of 200 records per second. The function is triggered every minute by [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/), producing consistent data flow for the pipeline. An [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) role grants the Lambda function permissions to write to Firehose and [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) Logs.\\n\\n### Streaming Layer\\n\\n**Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose** buffers incoming data for up to 5 minutes or 5 MB before writing to the destination. An IAM role provides Firehose with permissions to access S3 Tables via Lake Formation, write to the error bucket, and use [AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) for encryption.\\n\\n### Storage Layer\\n\\n**Amazon S3 Tables** stores data in Apache Iceberg format with automatic schema management and table optimization. The table bucket is encrypted using AWS KMS customer-managed keys.\\n\\n**Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) Error Bucket** captures failed deliveries from Firehose when records cannot be written to S3 Tables. The error bucket is encrypted with AWS KMS customer-managed keys and has versioning enabled for audit trails. Failed records are written to the `errors/` prefix with metadata about the failure reason, enabling troubleshooting and data recovery.\\n\\n### Governance Layer\\n\\n**AWS Lake Formation** grants explicit permissions (ALL, ALTER, DELETE, DESCRIBE, DROP, INSERT, SELECT) to the Firehose role for database, table, and column access, ensuring secure and governed data access patterns.\\n\\n### Monitoring Layer\\n\\n**Amazon CloudWatch Dashboard** provides real-time monitoring of Firehose metrics, Lambda performance, and S3 Tables storage with 9 pre-configured widgets tracking key operational metrics.\\n\\n## Data Schema\\n\\nThe solution generates IoT sensor data with the following schema:\\n\\n- **sensor_id** (string): Unique identifier for each sensor\\n- **timestamp** (long): Unix timestamp in seconds\\n- **location** (string): Physical location of the sensor\\n- **temperature** (double): Temperature reading in Celsius\\n- **humidity** (double): Humidity percentage\\n- **pressure** (double): Atmospheric pressure in hPa\\n\\nData generation rate: 200 records per second during Lambda execution, producing approximately 10,000 records per invocation and 600,000 records per hour across all sensors.\\n\\n## Prerequisites\\n\\n### One-Time Account Configuration\\n\\n1. **Enable S3 Tables Integration with Lake Formation**\\n   - Navigate to the [Amazon S3 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\\n   - Select **Table buckets** in the left navigation\\n   - Click **Enable integration**\\n   - This registers S3 Tables with AWS Lake Formation\\n\\n2. **Configure Lake Formation Administrator Permissions**\\n   - The IAM identity running Terraform requires Lake Formation administrator permissions\\n   - Navigate to the [AWS Lake Formation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lakeformation/)\\n   - Select **Administrative roles and tasks** \u2192 **Choose administrators**\\n   - Add your IAM user or role\\n\\n   Alternatively, use the AWS CLI:\\n   ```bash\\n   aws lakeformation put-data-lake-settings \\\\\\n     --data-lake-settings \'{\\"DataLakeAdmins\\":[{\\"DataLakePrincipalIdentifier\\":\\"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:user/YOUR_USER\\"}]}\'\\n   ```\\n\\n### Required Tools\\n\\n- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) >= 1.0\\n- [AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) >= 2.15 (for S3 Tables support)\\n- AWS credentials configured\\n- Terraform AWS Provider >= 6.0 (for S3 Tables schema support)\\n\\n### Validation Script\\n\\nThe solution includes a validation script to verify all prerequisites before deployment:\\n\\n```bash\\n./validate-prerequisites.sh\\n```\\n\\nThis script checks:\\n- AWS credentials configuration\\n- S3 Tables integration with Lake Formation is enabled\\n- Current IAM identity is a Lake Formation administrator\\n- Required IAM permissions are available\\n- AWS CLI version supports S3 Tables (v2.15+)\\n- Terraform is installed (v1.0+)\\n\\n## Deployment\\n\\n### Infrastructure as Code\\n\\nThe solution uses [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to provision all AWS resources. The deployment creates:\\n\\n- S3 Tables table bucket, namespace, and Iceberg table with schema (KMS encrypted)\\n- Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream with Iceberg destination\\n- Amazon S3 error bucket for failed deliveries (KMS encrypted)\\n- AWS Lambda data generator function (512 MB, triggered every minute)\\n- Amazon EventBridge schedule rule\\n- IAM roles and policies for Firehose and Lambda\\n- AWS KMS customer-managed encryption key\\n- Amazon CloudWatch dashboard with 9 monitoring widgets\\n- AWS Lake Formation permissions (automated via Terraform)\\n\\n### Deployment Steps\\n\\n1. Configure `terraform.tfvars` with your stack name (must be globally unique):\\n   ```hcl\\n   stack_name = \\"your-unique-stack-name\\"\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Deploy the infrastructure:\\n   ```bash\\n   terraform init\\n   terraform apply\\n   ```\\n\\nAll resources are created with Lake Formation permissions automatically granted during deployment.\\n\\n### Verification\\n\\nLambda begins sending data immediately. Wait 5-6 minutes for Firehose buffering, then verify data flow using the Amazon CloudWatch dashboard. The dashboard provides real-time visibility into:\\n\\n- Firehose incoming records and delivery metrics\\n- Lambda invocations and performance\\n- S3 Tables storage growth\\n\\nAccess the dashboard URL from Terraform outputs:\\n```bash\\nterraform output dashboard_url\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively, check for delivery errors:\\n```bash\\naws s3 ls s3://{stack_name}-errors/errors/ --recursive\\n```\\n\\nAn empty result indicates successful data delivery.\\n\\n## Querying Data\\n\\nAfter deployment, query the streaming data stored in S3 Tables using Apache Iceberg-compatible query engines:\\n\\n### View All Sensor Data\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM firehosetos3demo.firehosetos3demo LIMIT 100;\\n```\\n\\n### Average Temperature by Location\\n```sql\\nSELECT \\n    location, \\n    AVG(temperature) as avg_temp,\\n    COUNT(*) as reading_count\\nFROM firehosetos3demo.firehosetos3demo\\nGROUP BY location\\nORDER BY avg_temp DESC;\\n```\\n\\n### Recent High Temperature Alerts\\n```sql\\nSELECT \\n    sensor_id, \\n    temperature, \\n    humidity,\\n    timestamp,\\n    from_unixtime(timestamp) as reading_time\\nFROM firehosetos3demo.firehosetos3demo\\nWHERE temperature > 25\\nORDER BY timestamp DESC\\nLIMIT 50;\\n```\\n\\n### Sensor Activity Summary\\n```sql\\nSELECT \\n    sensor_id,\\n    location,\\n    COUNT(*) as total_readings,\\n    AVG(temperature) as avg_temp,\\n    AVG(humidity) as avg_humidity,\\n    MIN(timestamp) as first_reading,\\n    MAX(timestamp) as last_reading\\nFROM firehosetos3demo.firehosetos3demo\\nGROUP BY sensor_id, location\\nORDER BY sensor_id;\\n```\\n\\n## Monitoring and Operations\\n\\n### CloudWatch Dashboard\\n\\nThe solution includes a pre-configured Amazon CloudWatch dashboard with the following metrics:\\n\\n**Firehose Metrics:**\\n- Incoming records\\n- Delivery success/failure counts\\n- Data freshness (time from arrival to delivery)\\n- Bytes delivered\\n\\n**Lambda Metrics:**\\n- Invocations\\n- Errors\\n- Duration\\n\\n**S3 Tables Metrics:**\\n- Storage size\\n- File count\\n\\nAccess the dashboard URL from Terraform outputs:\\n```bash\\nterraform output dashboard_url\\n```\\n\\n### Error Monitoring\\n\\nCheck for delivery failures:\\n```bash\\naws s3 ls s3://{stack_name}-errors/errors/iceberg-failed/ --recursive\\n```\\n\\n## Security Considerations\\n\\n### Encryption\\n\\n- **At Rest**: All data in S3 Tables and the error bucket is encrypted using AWS KMS customer-managed keys with automatic key rotation enabled\\n- **In Transit**: All data transfers use TLS encryption\\n\\n### Access Control\\n\\n- **IAM Roles**: Least-privilege IAM policies for Lambda and Firehose\\n- **Lake Formation**: Fine-grained access control at database, table, and column levels\\n- **KMS Key Policies**: Explicit permissions for service principals and roles\\n\\n## Cost Optimization\\n\\nThe solution implements several cost optimization strategies:\\n\\n- **Firehose Buffering**: 5-minute or 5 MB buffering reduces the number of small files written to S3 Tables\\n- **CloudWatch Logs Retention**: 1-day retention for Lambda logs reduces storage costs\\n- **S3 Tables Maintenance**: Automatic compaction and optimization reduce storage costs over time\\n\\n## Technical Implementation Notes\\n\\n### Schema Definition\\n\\nAmazon Kinesis Data Firehose requires S3 Tables to have a pre-defined schema. The solution uses Terraform AWS Provider 6.0+ which supports schema definition via the `metadata` block:\\n\\n```hcl\\nmetadata {\\n  iceberg {\\n    schema {\\n      field {\\n        name     = \\"sensor_id\\"\\n        type     = \\"string\\"\\n        required = false\\n      }\\n      # Additional fields...\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Lake Formation Permissions\\n\\nThe solution uses Terraform\'s `null_resource` with `local-exec` provisioner to automatically grant Lake Formation permissions using the AWS CLI during deployment. This approach is necessary because Terraform\'s `aws_lakeformation_permissions` resource does not support S3 Tables catalog ARNs (format: `account:s3tablescatalog/bucket-name`).\\n\\nThe `null_resource` executes after the foundational resources (S3 Tables, IAM roles) are created but before the Firehose delivery stream is provisioned. This ensures the Firehose role has the required Lake Formation permissions (ALL, ALTER, DELETE, DESCRIBE, DROP, INSERT, SELECT) for database, table, and column access before attempting to write data.\\n\\nWithout these permissions, Firehose would fail with `Lakeformation.AccessDenied` errors when attempting to write to S3 Tables. The automated approach eliminates manual permission configuration and ensures consistent deployments.\\n\\n### Firehose Buffering\\n\\nAmazon Kinesis Data Firehose buffers data for up to 5 minutes (300 seconds) or 5 MB before writing to S3 Tables. This buffering mechanism optimizes write performance and reduces the number of small files, which improves query performance and reduces costs.\\n\\n## Cleanup\\n\\nTo remove all resources:\\n\\n```bash\\nterraform destroy\\n```\\n\\n**Note**: The AWS KMS key will be scheduled for deletion with a 7-day waiting period (AWS minimum).\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThis solution demonstrates a production-ready pattern for streaming data ingestion into Amazon S3 Tables using Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. The architecture provides automatic buffering, schema management, encryption, governance, and monitoring capabilities suitable for real-world analytics workloads. The use of Apache Iceberg format through S3 Tables enables efficient querying, ACID transactions, and time travel capabilities for your streaming data.\\n\\nBy combining serverless compute (Lambda), managed streaming (Firehose), and analytics-optimized storage (S3 Tables), you can build scalable real-time analytics pipelines without managing infrastructure. The solution processes 600,000 records per hour with sub-minute query latency, demonstrating the power of modern serverless data architectures on AWS."},{"id":"recursive-language-models-strands-agentcore","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/recursive-language-models-strands-agentcore","source":"@site/blog/2026-01-19-recursive-language-models-strands-agentcore.mdx","title":"Build Recursive Language Models on AWS in Minutes with Strands Agents and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore","description":"Learn how to implement Recursive Language Models (RLMs) from MIT CSAIL research using Strands Agents and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

While frontier models now reach 1 million tokens (Nova Premier, Claude Sonnet 4.5), workloads analyzing entire codebases, document collections, or multi-hour conversations can easily exceed 10 million tokens\u2014far beyond any single model\'s capacity.\\n\\nThis post demonstrates **Recursive Language Models (RLMs)**, an inference strategy from [MIT CSAIL research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601) that enables scaling to inputs far beyond context windows. What makes this implementation special: **Strands Agents** and **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore** reduce what could be weeks of glue code and deployment work to just a few hours of development.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## What Are Recursive Language Models?\\n\\nTraditional approaches to long contexts use summarization or RAG. These struggle with information-dense tasks requiring examination of the full input.\\n\\n**Recursive Language Models** are an inference pattern for handling inputs far larger than any model context window. Instead of stuffing the entire dataset into the prompt, the full context lives outside the model as an external context buffer (a Python variable). The model then generates code to search, filter, and chunk the context, and uses recursive sub-calls on only the relevant pieces. Finally, results are aggregated through deterministic code rather than attention over the full input.\\n\\nThis approach is especially effective for tasks like \\"find all occurrences,\\" \\"count all items,\\" or \\"extract all endpoints,\\" where missing even one chunk causes incorrect results.\\n\\n**In our implementation, recursion depth is 1:** the root model uses sub-calls to smaller models, and aggregation happens in code (not through nested RLMs).\\n\\n### RLM in Action: Minimal Pattern\\n\\n```python\\n# Context lives outside the model as a Python variable\\ncontext = load_large_codebase()  # can exceed model context windows by 100x+\\n\\n# Model writes code to probe and filter\\napi_files = search(context, pattern=r\\"@app\\\\.route\\")\\n\\n# Recursive sub-calls on filtered chunks\\nendpoints = []\\nfor file in api_files:\\n    result = llm_query(f\\"Extract endpoint info from:\\\\n{file}\\")\\n    endpoints.append(result)\\n\\n# Deterministic aggregation\\nreturn aggregate(endpoints)\\n```\\n\\n### RLM vs RAG: When to Use Each\\n\\n| Scenario | RAG | RLM |\\n|----------|-----|-----|\\n| **Known query upfront** | \u2705 Efficient retrieval | \u26a0\ufe0f Overkill |\\n| **\\"Find all\\" / \\"Count all\\"** | \u274c May miss chunks | \u2705 Exhaustive coverage |\\n| **Relevance-based QA** | \u2705 Fast, targeted | \u26a0\ufe0f Slower |\\n| **Multi-step reasoning over full context** | \u274c Limited by retrieval | \u2705 Code-driven exploration |\\n\\n**RAG struggles when:** you don\'t know what to retrieve upfront, when correctness depends on coverage (not relevance), or when you need \\"verify-all\\" guarantees.\\n\\n### Research Results\\n\\nThe [MIT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601) demonstrates RLMs:\\n- Successfully handle inputs **up to 100x beyond model context windows**\\n- Outperform base LLMs and common long-context scaffolds on long-context retrieval benchmarks\\n- Scale costs with task complexity, not input size\\n\\n**Note**: Performance examples in this post are illustrative. Actual results vary by model, task complexity, and context structure.\\n\\n## Why Strands + AgentCore Makes This Easy\\n\\nBuilding RLMs from scratch requires weeks of work: agent loop orchestration, REPL sandboxing, model invocation logic, deployment infrastructure, scaling configuration, and observability. **Strands Agents** and **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore** eliminate this complexity.\\n\\n### Architecture Overview\\n\\n![RLM on AWS Architecture](/img/blog/rlm-on-aws.png)\\n*RLM implementation using Strands Agents and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore*\\n\\nThe architecture shows the complete flow from user query to final answer:\\n\\n### Strands Agents: Orchestration Made Simple\\n\\n[Strands Agents](https://github.com/awslabs/strands-agents) is an open-source Python SDK for building AI agents. It provides:\\n- **Agent loop orchestration** - Handles iterative LLM \u2192 code execution \u2192 LLM cycles automatically\\n- **Tool calling** - Built-in Python REPL tool with output management\\n- **Model integration** - Native [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) support with streaming\\n- **State management** - Tracks conversation history and execution context\\n\\n**Impact:** What would take weeks of infrastructure code becomes ~200 lines.\\n\\n### Amazon Bedrock AgentCore: Deployment Without the Pain\\n\\n[Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/) provides serverless runtime for AI agents:\\n- **Long-running execution** - 15-minute idle timeout when not processing (not a max runtime limit)\\n- **Automatic scaling** - Handles concurrent requests without capacity planning\\n- **Session isolation** - Each invocation gets isolated environment\\n- **ARM64 optimization** - [AWS Graviton](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) processors for cost efficiency\\n- **Built-in observability** - [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) logs and metrics\\n\\n**Impact:** Deployment is a standard CDK workflow, and invocation happens via the AgentCore Runtime API. RLM experiments that take 5+ minutes run without timeout issues. Safety limits (max sub-calls, output buffer) prevent runaway execution.\\n\\n### Cost Intuition\\n\\nIn practice, the root model spends tokens on planning and code generation, while sub-calls only process filtered slices of the context. This makes total token usage closer to \\"work performed\\" rather than \\"data size\\"\u2014often landing closer to planning plus the slices you inspect (for example, tens to a few hundred thousand tokens for many workloads, depending on how much content is actually analyzed).\\n\\n### Amazon Bedrock: Model Choice\\n\\n[Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models from leading AI companies like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, OpenAI, and Amazon through a single API. This model choice is critical for RLM implementations\u2014different tasks benefit from different model strengths in reasoning, code generation, and cost efficiency.\\n\\nFollowing the MIT paper\'s two-model approach, we use a root model for orchestration and a smaller model for sub-calls:\\n\\n**Supported Root Models:**\\n- **Amazon Nova Pro** - 300K context, strong reasoning\\n- **Claude 4.5 Sonnet** - 200K context (1M beta), excellent code generation\\n- **Claude 4.5 Opus** - 200K context, frontier performance\\n- **GPT-OSS 120B** - 128K context, open-source option\\n\\n**Supported Sub-Call Models:**\\n- **Amazon Nova Micro** - 128K context, optimized for speed\\n- **Claude 4.5 Haiku** - Fast, cost-efficient\\n- **Amazon Nova Lite** - Balanced performance\\n\\nThis two-tier approach balances capability and efficiency: a powerful model for strategy, a fast model for execution. Our implementation is model-agnostic\u2014swap models via configuration without code changes.\\n\\n## How It Works\\n\\n### REPL Environment\\n\\nThe core innovation is loading the entire input context as an external context buffer (Python variable) accessible to the LLM. The environment provides:\\n- `context` variable containing the full input\\n- `llm_query(prompt)` function for recursive sub-LM calls\\n- Standard Python libraries for text processing (regex, string manipulation)\\n- Isolated execution preventing access to system resources\\n\\nThe LLM writes Python code to interact with this environment, executing operations like regex searches, chunking, and filtering without loading the entire context into its neural network.\\n\\n### System Prompt Design\\n\\nBased on [MIT paper Appendix D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601), the system prompt is minimal and example-driven:\\n\\n**Core Instructions:**\\n- Context is available as a Python variable in REPL, not in the prompt\\n- Use code to probe, filter, and chunk the context\\n- Make recursive `llm_query()` calls on filtered chunks\\n- Return final answer directly (no special format required)\\n\\n**Example Strategies:**\\n- Regex filtering: Search for keywords without reading entire context\\n- Uniform chunking: Split into equal-sized pieces for parallel processing\\n- Semantic chunking: Use document structure (headers, file boundaries)\\n\\n**Example Pattern:**\\n```python\\n# Search in chunks\\nchunk_size = 50000  # ~12.5K tokens\\nfor i in range(0, len(context), chunk_size):\\n    chunk = context[i:i+chunk_size]\\n    result = llm_query(f\\"Find the magic number in: {chunk}\\")\\n    print(result)\\n```\\n\\nThe prompt avoids prescriptive \\"ALWAYS/NEVER\\" rules, letting models develop their own strategies.\\n\\n### Agent Loop\\n\\nThe Strands Agent orchestrates iterative REPL interaction:\\n1. Root LM receives query and context metadata (length, structure)\\n2. Root LM generates Python code to execute in REPL\\n3. Code executes, output returned (truncated to prevent overflow)\\n4. Root LM sees output, decides to continue or return answer\\n5. Loop continues until answer provided or timeout\\n\\nThis iterative process allows the model to refine its approach based on execution feedback.\\n\\n### Asynchronous Processing\\n\\nAll experiments run asynchronously by default:\\n- Immediate response with task ID and session ID\\n- Client polls for results (no timeout issues)\\n- Tasks can run for minutes or hours\\n- Results automatically saved to [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) with full metadata\\n- 15-minute idle timeout only applies when NOT processing\\n\\nThis enables long-running RLM tasks without connection timeouts.\\n\\n### Recursive Sub-Calls\\n\\nThe `llm_query()` function enables decomposition:\\n- Sub-calls use smaller model (Amazon Nova Micro) with smaller context\\n- Each sub-call is independent (no shared state except via code variables)\\n- Sub-calls can be batched in code (process multiple chunks in loop)\\n- Results stored in Python variables for aggregation\\n\\nThe paper uses max recursion depth of 1 (sub-calls are base LLMs, not RLMs).\\n\\n### Deployment\\n\\n[AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) deploys the RLM agent to AgentCore Runtime:\\n- Build ARM64 Docker image with Strands Agent code\\n- Create IAM role with Bedrock, S3, and CloudWatch permissions\\n- Deploy datasets (TREC, BrowseComp+, CodeQA) to S3 bucket\\n- Configure CloudWatch log group for traces\\n- Deploy AgentCore Runtime with container image\\n\\nAgentCore handles scaling, versioning, and observability automatically. Datasets are uploaded during `cdk deploy` and downloaded by the runtime on-demand.\\n\\n## Example: Analyzing Large Codebases\\n\\n**Task:** Identify all API endpoints and their authentication requirements in a codebase with hundreds of files.\\n\\n**Traditional Approach Limitations:**\\n- Direct LLM call: May exceed context window\\n- RAG: May miss endpoints, requires good chunking strategy upfront\\n- Manual analysis: Time-consuming, error-prone\\n\\n**RLM Approach:**\\n\\n1. **Probe:** Check total size, identify file boundaries\\n2. **Filter:** Use regex to find files with route decorators (`@app.route`, `@api.route`)\\n3. **Analyze:** Make sub-LM calls on each API file to extract endpoint details\\n4. **Aggregate:** Combine results into structured summary\\n\\n**Outcome:**\\n- Processes codebases beyond single model context limits\\n- Identifies all API endpoints systematically\\n- Extracts authentication requirements for each\\n- Completes in minutes with minimal sub-calls\\n\\n## Benchmarks and Findings\\n\\n### Performance on Long-Context Tasks\\n\\nWe evaluated RLM on benchmarks using real-world datasets (TREC, Tevatron BrowseComp+, LongBench-v2) deployed to S3.\\n\\n| Test | Context Size | Task | Dataset Source |\\n|------|--------------|------|----------------|\\n| OOLONG | 5,452 TREC entries | Count label frequencies | TREC coarse dataset |\\n| OOLONG-Pairs | 5,452 TREC entries | Find HUM/LOC pairs | TREC coarse dataset |\\n| BrowseComp-1K | 1,000 documents | Answer research query | Tevatron BrowseComp+ |\\n| CodeQA | Multi-file repos | Multi-choice reasoning | LongBench-v2 Code |\\n\\n**Key Findings:**\\n\\n**Accuracy for Retrieval Tasks:** Code-based counting and searching reduces hallucinations for tasks requiring exact matches. Direct model calls often produce inconsistent results on the same input.\\n\\n**Real Datasets:** All benchmarks use production datasets (~216MB total) deployed to S3 and loaded at runtime, simulating real-world information retrieval scenarios.\\n\\n**Async Execution:** All tests run asynchronously with results saved to S3, enabling long-running tasks without timeout issues.\\n\\n### Emergent Behaviors\\n\\nRLM trajectories showed interesting patterns:\\n\\n- **Regex filtering:** Models searched for keywords without reading entire context\\n- **Adaptive chunking:** Adjusted chunk sizes based on task complexity\\n- **Answer verification:** Made additional sub-calls to validate results\\n- **Strategic decisions:** Chose between \\"process all\\" vs \\"filter then process\\" strategies\\n\\n### Limitations\\n\\n1. **Async-first design:** All experiments run asynchronously; synchronous mode available but not recommended for long tasks\\n2. **Model-specific behavior:** Different models show varying chunking strategies and sub-call patterns\\n3. **Sub-call limits:** Max 50 sub-calls prevents runaway execution but may limit very complex tasks\\n4. **Debugging complexity:** Full trajectory examination needed via CloudWatch logs\\n5. **Dataset size:** Real datasets (TREC, BrowseComp+, CodeQA) are large files (~216MB total) deployed to S3\\n\\n## When to Use RLMs\\n\\n**Ideal for:**\\n- Information-dense aggregation across entire datasets\\n- Large codebase analysis (patterns, security, dependencies)\\n- Multi-document reasoning requiring synthesis\\n- Contexts beyond model limits\\n\\n**Use alternatives for:**\\n- Single-document QA within context window (direct calls)\\n- Sparse retrieval (RAG more efficient)\\n- Real-time requirements (RLM takes seconds to minutes)\\n- Simple extraction (regex/parsing sufficient)\\n\\n## Observability\\n\\nAgentCore provides CloudWatch integration for monitoring RLM trajectories:\\n\\n**Enable Transaction Search:**\\nOne-time setup to send X-Ray traces to CloudWatch Logs for GenAI Observability dashboard.\\n\\n**View Traces:**\\nCloudWatch \u2192 GenAI Observability shows:\\n- Complete RLM trajectories (each REPL iteration)\\n- Sub-LM call patterns (count, timing, token usage)\\n- Token efficiency (processed vs. context size)\\n- Execution time breakdown\\n\\n**Key Metrics:**\\n- Trajectory length: Number of REPL iterations (target: &lt;20)\\n- Sub-call count: Recursive invocations (target: &lt;30)\\n- Token efficiency: % of context actually processed\\n- Success rate: FINAL() vs. timeouts\\n\\n## Best Practices\\n\\n### System Prompt Design\\n- Keep it minimal and example-driven (following MIT paper)\\n- Show chunking strategies, don\'t prescribe them\\n- Let models develop their own approaches\\n- Emphasize `print()` for code outputs\\n\\n### Context Generation\\n- Real benchmarks: Deploy production datasets (TREC, BrowseComp+, CodeQA) to S3 (~216MB total)\\n- Runtime downloads datasets on-demand from S3\\n- Makes benchmarks representative of real-world scenarios\\n\\n### Safety\\n- Isolate REPL execution (no file system access)\\n- Limit output buffer (last 100 lines)\\n- Set max recursion depth (depth=1)\\n- Max sub-calls limit (50 in our implementation)\\n\\n### Error Handling\\n- Return exceptions to root model\\n- Retry transient Bedrock errors\\n- Use async mode for long-running tasks\\n- Log all trajectories to CloudWatch\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nThe complete implementation is available on GitHub with interactive CLI, deployment automation, and benchmark suite.\\n\\n### Quick Start\\n\\n```bash\\n# Clone repository\\ngit clone https://github.com/manu-mishra/RLMWithStrands\\ncd RLMWithStrands\\n\\n# Deploy to AWS\\ncd infra\\ncdk deploy\\n\\n# Run benchmarks\\npython runexperiments\\n# Interactive menu:\\n# 1. Run Benchmarks \u2192 Async (default) \u2192 Select model \u2192 Run All\\n# 2. Results saved to S3 automatically\\n```\\n\\n## Future Directions\\n\\n- **Deeper recursion:** Allow sub-RLMs (depth=2+) for hierarchical decomposition\\n- **Parallel sub-calls:** Execute multiple chunks simultaneously to reduce latency\\n- **Multi-modal RLMs:** Extend to images, audio, video processing\\n- **Fine-tuned models:** Train on RLM trajectories to improve chunking efficiency\\n- **Streaming results:** Return partial answers as they\'re computed\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nRecursive Language Models (RLMs) enable processing inputs far beyond model context windows by treating the dataset as an external context buffer and using code to probe, filter, and recursively analyze only the relevant parts. By combining Strands Agents (agent loop + REPL orchestration) with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore (serverless runtime + observability), you can go from research idea to working implementation in hours instead of weeks.\\n\\nThis approach is especially useful for \\"find all / count all / verify all\\" workloads such as large codebase analysis, multi-document synthesis, and long-horizon agent workflows\u2014where traditional long-context prompting or retrieval-only strategies can miss critical details.\\n\\n**Key Benefits:**\\n- **Model choice** - Root + sub-call model flexibility (Nova, Claude, GPT-OSS)\\n- **Serverless runtime** - AgentCore handles scaling and deployment\\n- **Observability** - CloudWatch GenAI dashboard with full trajectories\\n- **Async execution + safety limits** - Long-running tasks with guardrails\\n\\n## Resources\\n\\n- **GitHub**: [github.com/manu-mishra/RLMWithStrands](https://github.com/manu-mishra/RLMWithStrands)\\n- **Research Paper**: [Recursive Language Models (arXiv:2512.24601)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601)\\n- **Strands Agents**: [github.com/awslabs/strands-agents](https://github.com/awslabs/strands-agents)\\n- **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore**: [aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore)\\n- **Amazon Bedrock**: [aws.amazon.com/bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock)\\n- **AWS CDK**: [docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk)\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Tags**: #AmazonBedrock #GenerativeAI #AgentCore #StrandsAgents #MachineLearning #AWS"},{"id":"aws-reinvent-2025-reinvented-powered-by-mcp","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/aws-reinvent-2025-reinvented-powered-by-mcp","source":"@site/blog/2025-10-27-aws-reinvent-2025-reinvented-powered-by-mcp.mdx","title":"AWS Re:Invent 2025, Reinvented \u2014 Powered by MCP","description":"Comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server providing intelligent access to AWS re:Invent 2025 session catalog with 1,843 sessions, advanced search capabilities, and speaker discovery.","date":"2025-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"aws reinvent","permalink":"/blog/tags/aws-reinvent"},{"inline":true,"label":"mcp","permalink":"/blog/tags/mcp"},{"inline":true,"label":"ai assistant","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai-assistant"},{"inline":true,"label":"conference","permalink":"/blog/tags/conference"},{"inline":true,"label":"cloud computing","permalink":"/blog/tags/cloud-computing"},{"inline":true,"label":"aws community","permalink":"/blog/tags/aws-community"},{"inline":true,"label":"claude desktop","permalink":"/blog/tags/claude-desktop"}],"readingTime":3.25,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Manu Mishra","title":"Solutions Architect & Applied Software Engineer","url":"https://github.com/manu-mishra","image_url":"/img/logo.png","imageURL":"/img/logo.png","socials":{},"key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"aws-reinvent-2025-reinvented-powered-by-mcp","title":"AWS Re:Invent 2025, Reinvented \u2014 Powered by MCP","description":"Comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server providing intelligent access to AWS re:Invent 2025 session catalog with 1,843 sessions, advanced search capabilities, and speaker discovery.","keywords":["aws reinvent","mcp","model context protocol","conference navigation","aws sessions","speaker discovery","ai assistant","cloud computing","aws community","claude desktop"],"image":"/img/blog/reinvent-2025-mcp.png","authors":{"name":"Manu Mishra","title":"Solutions Architect & Applied Software Engineer","url":"https://github.com/manu-mishra","image_url":"/img/logo.png","imageURL":"/img/logo.png"},"tags":["aws reinvent","mcp","ai assistant","conference","cloud computing","aws community","claude desktop"],"date":"2025-10-27T00:00:00.000Z"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Build Recursive Language Models on AWS in Minutes with Strands Agents and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore","permalink":"/blog/recursive-language-models-strands-agentcore"},"nextItem":{"title":"Google\'s EmbeddingGemma on AWS Lambda - A Curiosity-Driven Experiment","permalink":"/blog/embeddings-gemma-on-lambda"}},"content":"Every year, AWS re:Invent brings together thousands of builders, leaders, and innovators to explore the future of cloud.

For real workloads, [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) is the right choice. This project explores what\'s possible when you push serverless boundaries.*\\n\\n## 1. The idea\\n\\nAfter my [BitNet Lambda experiment](https://community.aws/content/2ynHjrct8JLUEN6mADtT2IYh5bR/microsoft-bitnet-1-58-bit-llms-on-aws-lambda), I kept thinking: what about embeddings? I had text generation working on Lambda, but what about the other half of modern AI applications?\\n\\nGoogle\'s EmbeddingGemma caught my attention\u2014300M parameters, multilingual, designed for efficiency. Could it work on Lambda? Only one way to find out.\\n\\nSo I fired up Amazon Q Developer and started experimenting.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## 2. Why embeddings matter\\n\\nModern AI applications need both text generation and embeddings. RAG systems, semantic search, document processing\u2014they all require this dual capability. I had the generation part working with BitNet, but what about embeddings?\\n\\nEmbeddingGemma sits in a sweet spot: 300M parameters (~1.2GB) with multilingual support for 100+ languages. Unlike massive text generation models, embedding models are:\\n- **Predictable**: Fixed output dimensions (768 floats)\\n- **Efficient**: Single forward pass, no autoregressive generation\\n- **Compact**: Smaller memory footprint than multi-billion parameter LLMs\\n\\nThat efficiency profile makes \\"Lambda + Embeddings\\" the perfect complement to my BitNet experiment\u2014completing the serverless AI toolkit.\\n\\n## 3. The architecture\\n\\nThe architecture stayed simple: API Gateway triggers a Lambda function with 2GB memory. Inside lives a container image with transformers, sentence-transformers, and the complete EmbeddingGemma model. Lambda processes the text and returns a 768-dimensional vector.\\n\\nThanks to Amazon Q\'s help, I optimized the container to embed the entire model (~1.2GB) while keeping cold starts reasonable. No external model loading, no S3 downloads\u2014everything lives in the container.\\n\\n## 4. Amazon Q as co-pilot\\n\\nAmazon Q CLI didn\'t just automate\u2014it elevated the entire workflow. When I asked it to create a Dockerfile that could efficiently package transformers and the EmbeddingGemma model, it didn\'t just generate code\u2014it explained why sentence-transformers was the right choice over raw transformers.\\n\\nFor infrastructure, Q generated a clean CDK stack targeting Lambda with ARM64 architecture and 2GB memory. When builds failed or performance lagged, Q helped interpret CloudWatch logs and suggested memory optimizations.\\n\\nHaving Claude Sonnet inside Q made this feel like pair programming with someone who actually understood ML deployment patterns.\\n\\n## 5. Performance results\\n\\nThe numbers tell the story:\\n- **Cold start**: 12 seconds (not bad for a 300M model)\\n- **Warm inference**: 0.12-0.33 seconds per embedding\\n- **Cost**: ~$0.001 per request for short texts\\n- **Memory sweet spot**: 2GB (4GB+ shows no improvement)\\n\\nCombined with BitNet for text generation, this setup creates a complete serverless AI toolkit that shines for:\\n- **RAG systems**: BitNet for generation, EmbeddingGemma for retrieval\\n- **Semantic search**: Document vectorization and similarity matching\\n- **Prototype APIs**: Quick AI services for testing and experimentation\\n\\nIt struggles with:\\n- **Batch processing**: Linear scaling kills economics\\n- **Real-time chat**: 12-second cold starts hurt UX\\n- **High throughput**: Concurrent requests need full memory allocation\\n\\n## 6. The convergence\\n\\nTwo trends are colliding: models are getting more efficient while serverless platforms evolve. EmbeddingGemma represents the \\"efficient model\\" side\u2014compact, purpose-built, and CPU-friendly.\\n\\nOn the platform side, we\'re seeing serverless runtimes optimize for AI workloads. When these trends meet\u2014lightweight models and AI-aware serverless compute\u2014deploying embeddings will be as casual as deploying a REST API.\\n\\n## 7. Reality check\\n\\nLet\'s be honest about the numbers:\\n\\n**Text length scaling**:\\n- 10 characters: 0.32s\\n- 99 characters: 1.05s  \\n- 588 characters: 4.06s\\n\\n**Memory efficiency**:\\n- 2GB: Optimal performance\\n- 4GB+: No improvement, 2x cost\\n\\n**Infrastructure overhead**: 0.7-0.8 seconds of the total latency is network + AWS API processing, not model inference.\\n\\n## 8. Why not production\\n\\nWhile technically successful, several factors make this unsuitable for serious workloads:\\n\\n**Economics don\'t scale**: 2GB memory allocation for sporadic requests burns money. SageMaker\'s auto-scaling and GPU optimization provide better cost-per-embedding at volume.\\n\\n**Cold start penalty**: 12-second delays kill user experience for interactive applications.\\n\\n**Better alternatives exist**: Purpose-built ML infrastructure (SageMaker, ECS with GPUs) offers superior performance and economics for production embedding workloads.\\n\\n## 9. The real value\\n\\nThis experiment\'s worth isn\'t in production deployment\u2014it\'s about curiosity. What happens when you run Google\'s EmbeddingGemma in AWS Lambda? Can a 300M parameter embedding model really work in serverless compute? How does it perform?\\n\\n**Curiosity-driven insights**: How EmbeddingGemma behaves in Lambda\'s constraints, memory optimization patterns for embedding models, and container packaging strategies you can only discover by trying.\\n\\n**Learning by doing**: Understanding where EmbeddingGemma\'s efficiency meets Lambda\'s limitations, and where the serverless tax becomes prohibitive for ML workloads.\\n\\n**Future signals**: As embedding models get more efficient and Lambda evolves, today\'s experiments with EmbeddingGemma become tomorrow\'s possibilities.\\n\\n## 10. Wrapping up\\n\\nRunning Google\'s EmbeddingGemma on AWS Lambda isn\'t about beating dedicated ML infrastructure\u2014it\'s about curiosity. What if you could deploy Google\'s embedding model as easily as a REST API? What would EmbeddingGemma\'s performance look like in Lambda? How much would it cost?\\n\\nThe question was simple: \\"What about embeddings on Lambda?\\" Sometimes the best experiments come from pure curiosity about what\'s possible when you combine Google\'s efficient embedding model with AWS\'s serverless compute.\\n\\nThe complete EmbeddingGemma-on-Lambda implementation is on [GitHub](https://github.com/manu-mishra/embeddings-gemma-on-lambda). Clone it, try it, break it.

At ~1.1GB, the model fits within Lambda\'s constraints for serverless AI inference.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Deploying BitNet on Lambda\\n\\nMicrosoft\'s BitNet `microsoft/bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T` is a 1.58-bit quantized model that uses ternary values {-1, 0, +1}. At ~1.1GB, it fits within Lambda\'s memory and storage constraints.\\n\\n## Model Characteristics\\n\\nMicrosoft\'s BitNet `microsoft/bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T` uses 1.58-bit quantization with ternary values {-1, 0, +1}:\\n\\n- **Model size**: ~1.1GB including dependencies\\n- **CPU inference**: No GPU required\\n- **Memory requirements**: Fits within Lambda\'s memory limits\\n- **Text processing**: Designed for natural language tasks\\n\\nLambda bills per millisecond and doesn\'t provide GPU access, making CPU-optimized models necessary.\\n\\n## Architecture\\n\\n![BitNet Lambda Architecture](/img/blog/bitnet-lambda-architecture.svg)\\n\\nThe deployment uses serverless execution with the model embedded in the container image:\\n\\n- **No network calls during inference** - Model and code are in the same container\\n- **Single deployment unit** - No external model storage dependencies\\n- **Consistent behavior** - Same environment across all invocations\\n\\n### Multi-Stage Docker Build\\n\\nThe deployment uses a multi-stage Docker build that separates compilation from runtime.\\n\\n**Stage 1: Builder Environment**\\n\\nCreates a development environment to compile BitNet from source. Uses `python:3.9-bullseye` with cmake, build-essential, git, and clang. \\n\\nThe critical step is generating ARM-optimized computational kernels. Lambda runs on ARM64 processors, so BitNet\'s code generation utility pre-compiles optimized matrix multiplication kernels for this architecture.\\n\\nCompilation includes Lambda-specific optimizations: OpenMP disabled (`-DGGML_OPENMP=OFF`) because Lambda\'s sandboxed environment doesn\'t support shared memory operations. ARM template optimizations enabled (`-DBITNET_ARM_TL1=ON`) for ARM64 instruction sets. Static linking (`-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF`) embeds all dependencies into the binary.\\n\\n**Stage 2: Runtime Environment**\\n\\nCreates a minimal production environment using `python:3.9-slim`. Installs only AWS Lambda Runtime Interface Client (`awslambdaric`) and `requests` library.\\n\\nCopies only the compiled `llama-server` binary and BitNet model file from the builder stage. The final container includes the optimized binary without build tools, source code, or compilation artifacts.\\n\\n```dockerfile\\n# Stage 1: Builder - Heavy build environment\\nFROM python:3.9-bullseye as builder\\n\\n# Install build dependencies\\nRUN apt-get update && \\\\\\n    apt-get install -y cmake build-essential git clang && \\\\\\n    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\\n\\n# Copy BitNet source and model\\nCOPY temp/BitNet /app/BitNet\\nCOPY temp/models/BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T/ggml-model-i2_s.gguf /app/BitNet/models/BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T/\\n\\n# Generate ARM-optimized kernels for Lambda\'s ARM64 runtime\\nRUN python utils/codegen_tl1.py --model bitnet_b1_58-3B --BM 160,320,320 --BK 64,128,64 --bm 32,64,32\\n\\n# Build with Lambda-specific optimizations\\nRUN cmake -B build -DBITNET_ARM_TL1=ON -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \\\\\\n    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DGGML_OPENMP=OFF\\nRUN cmake --build build --config Release\\n\\n# Stage 2: Runtime - Minimal production environment\\nFROM python:3.9-slim\\n\\n# Install only runtime dependencies\\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir awslambdaric requests\\n\\n# Copy only the compiled binary and model from builder stage\\nCOPY --from=builder /app/BitNet/build/bin/llama-server /app/bin/\\nCOPY --from=builder /app/BitNet/models/BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T/ggml-model-i2_s.gguf /app/models/\\n\\n# Copy Lambda handler and set up runtime\\nCOPY app/lambda_handler.py /var/task/\\nWORKDIR /var/task\\nCMD [\\"python\\", \\"-m\\", \\"awslambdaric\\", \\"lambda_handler.lambda_handler\\"]\\n```\\n\\n**Build Process**\\n\\nThis multi-stage approach reduces final image size and ensures Lambda compatibility by including ARM64 optimizations and removing problematic dependencies like OpenMP. Each deployment requires full compilation, but this produces a container optimized for Lambda\'s constraints.\\n\\n### Lambda Runtime Optimizations\\n\\nThe Lambda environment requires specific threading configurations to prevent model initialization failures:\\n\\n```python\\n# Critical environment overrides for Lambda\\nos.environ[\'OMP_NUM_THREADS\'] = \'1\'\\nos.environ[\'OMP_THREAD_LIMIT\'] = \'1\'\\nos.environ[\'GGML_OPENMP\'] = \'OFF\'\\nos.environ[\'KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK\'] = \'TRUE\'\\n```\\n\\nThese settings prevent the threading conflicts that plague many ML workloads in Lambda\'s sandboxed environment.\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nThe complete working implementation is available at **[github.com/manu-mishra/one-bit-llm-on-lambda](https://github.com/manu-mishra/one-bit-llm-on-lambda)**. The deployment process is streamlined into three modular scripts:\\n\\n### 1. Initialize and Download\\n```bash\\ngit clone https://github.com/manu-mishra/one-bit-llm-on-lambda.git\\ncd one-bit-llm-on-lambda\\n./scripts/1-initialize.sh\\n```\\n\\n**Important:** You need a Hugging Face token to download the BitNet model:\\n- Get your token from: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens\\n- Create a token with \\"Read\\" permissions\\n- The script includes retry logic if authentication fails\\n\\nDownloads BitNet source and model (~1.1GB) from Microsoft\'s Hugging Face repository.\\n\\n### 2. Deploy Infrastructure\\n```bash\\ncd cdk && python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt && cd ..\\n./scripts/2-deploy-lambda.sh\\n```\\nUses AWS CDK to provision AWS Lambda, Amazon ECR, IAM roles, and supporting infrastructure.\\n\\n### 3. Test Inference\\n```bash\\n./scripts/3-test-lambda.sh\\n```\\nTests the deployment with a sample prompt. For performance testing across memory configurations:\\n```bash\\n./scripts/5-benchmark.sh\\n```\\n\\nThe repository includes AWS CDK infrastructure code, Docker configuration, testing utilities, and documentation.\\n\\n## Performance Results\\n\\nBenchmarking across different memory configurations:\\n\\n### Memory Configuration\\n```python\\nLAMBDA_MEMORY_SIZE = 2048  # 2GB recommended\\n```\\n\\n### Test Results\\n| Memory | Cold Start | Warm (10 tokens) | Warm (50 tokens) | Warm (100 tokens) |\\n|--------|------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|\\n| 2GB    | 12s        | 7s               | 18s              | 32s               |\\n| 6GB    | 13s        | 6s               | 18s              | 32s               |\\n| 10GB   | 12s        | 7s               | 18s              | 32s               |\\n\\n**Observations:**\\n- Cold start times: 12-13 seconds across memory configurations\\n- Warm inference scales with token count\\n- Memory above 2GB shows minimal improvement\\n\\n### Inference Parameters\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"prompt\\": \\"User: Explain 1-bit quantization benefits\\\\n\\\\nAssistant:\\",\\n  \\"n_predict\\": 32,\\n  \\"temperature\\": 0.7,\\n  \\"top_p\\": 0.9,\\n  \\"top_k\\": 40,\\n  \\"repeat_penalty\\": 1.1\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThese parameters control response generation. The model handles conversational AI, code generation, and text analysis tasks.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Monitoring and Debugging\\n\\nCloudWatch Logs capture everything:\\n```bash\\n# View recent logs\\naws logs tail /aws/lambda/{your-log-group-name} --follow\\n```\\n\\nKey metrics to monitor:\\n- **Cold start duration**: 12-13 seconds\\n- **Inference latency**: Scales with token count (7s for 10 tokens, 32s for 100 tokens)\\n- **Memory utilization**: Monitor against allocated limit\\n- **Error rates**: Watch for OOM or timeout errors\\n\\n## Implementation Notes\\n\\nThis deployment pattern shows that:\\n- **Quantized models** can run on Lambda\'s CPU infrastructure\\n- **Container-based deployment** enables ML workloads on Lambda\\n- **Performance scales** with token generation requirements\\n- **Cold start times** are consistent across memory configurations\\n\\nThe approach works for applications with sporadic inference needs where 12-13 second cold starts are acceptable.\\n\\n## What\'s Next?\\n\\nBitNet + Lambda deployment has specific trade-offs. 1.58-bit quantization enables serverless deployment but has accuracy limitations compared to full-precision models. This makes it suitable for specific use cases.\\n\\nAreas of development include:\\n- **Quantization techniques**: Improving model accuracy while maintaining efficiency\\n- **Application matching**: Finding use cases where the efficiency/accuracy trade-off works\\n- **Hybrid workflows**: Combining lightweight models with full-precision models for different tasks\\n- **Model routing**: Automatically selecting appropriate model sizes based on request complexity\\n\\nThe field is developing, and current approaches may be replaced by better quantization methods or deployment patterns.\\n\\n**Key takeaway**: 1.58-bit quantization enables LLM deployment on Lambda\'s CPU infrastructure. This approach has specific use cases and performance characteristics, demonstrating one path for serverless AI inference without GPU requirements."},{"id":"threat-modeling-autonomous-ai","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/threat-modeling-autonomous-ai","source":"@site/blog/2025-05-16-threat-modeling-autonomous-ai.mdx","title":"Threat Modeling for Autonomous AI - What OWASP Wants You to Know","description":"As large language models (LLMs) evolve from passive responders into autonomous agents that can reason, plan, and act\u2014welcome to the age of Agentic AI.

These systems don\'t just generate answers; they browse the web, execute scripts, send emails, and even orchestrate other agents. And with that autonomy comes an entirely new class of cybersecurity threats.\\n\\nThe OWASP Agentic AI: Threats and Mitigations report is the first of its kind to lay out a structured threat model tailored to the unique risks introduced by LLM-powered agents. From memory poisoning and cascading hallucinations to identity spoofing and rogue agents\u2014this is the new frontline of AI security.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The Shift from Passive to Agentic AI\\n\\nTraditional LLMs operate within strict boundaries\u2014they receive prompts and generate responses based on their training data. Agentic AI systems, however, can:\\n\\n- Make autonomous decisions based on goals and context\\n- Access external tools and APIs to gather information\\n- Execute actions in digital (and potentially physical) environments\\n- Learn and adapt their strategies over time\\n- Collaborate with other AI agents to achieve complex objectives\\n\\nThis expanded capability set creates an entirely new attack surface that traditional security approaches aren\'t designed to address.\\n\\n## The OWASP Agentic AI Threat Model\\n\\nThe OWASP report identifies several critical threat categories unique to autonomous AI systems:\\n\\n### 1. Agent Memory Manipulation\\n\\nUnlike traditional systems where memory is protected by access controls, an AI agent\'s \\"memory\\" exists as context that can be manipulated through carefully crafted inputs.\\n\\n**Key Threats:**\\n- **Context Poisoning**: Injecting false information into the agent\'s working memory\\n- **Memory Overflow**: Exploiting limited context windows to force the agent to forget critical constraints or instructions\\n- **Prompt Leaking**: Tricking the agent into revealing sensitive parts of its configuration or instructions\\n\\n**Mitigations:**\\n- Implement memory segregation between system instructions and user inputs\\n- Create immutable memory regions for critical constraints and safety guardrails\\n- Regularly validate the consistency of the agent\'s memory state\\n\\n### 2. Tool and API Exploitation\\n\\nAgentic AI systems often have access to external tools and APIs, creating potential pathways for attackers to exploit.\\n\\n**Key Threats:**\\n- **Tool Injection**: Manipulating the agent to use tools in unintended ways\\n- **API Privilege Escalation**: Tricking the agent into using APIs with higher privileges than necessary\\n- **Chained Tool Attacks**: Using sequences of seemingly benign tool calls that combine for malicious purposes\\n\\n**Mitigations:**\\n- Implement least-privilege access for all tool and API integrations\\n- Create tool-specific safety boundaries and validation\\n- Monitor and audit all tool usage patterns\\n- Implement rate limiting and anomaly detection for tool calls\\n\\n### 3. Multi-Agent Vulnerabilities\\n\\nAs systems begin to deploy multiple agents that interact with each other, new attack vectors emerge.\\n\\n**Key Threats:**\\n- **Agent Impersonation**: Spoofing the identity of trusted agents\\n- **Collaborative Exploitation**: Using one compromised agent to manipulate others\\n- **Consensus Manipulation**: Influencing multi-agent decision processes through targeted attacks\\n\\n**Mitigations:**\\n- Implement strong agent authentication mechanisms\\n- Create trust boundaries between agents with different privilege levels\\n- Monitor inter-agent communications for anomalous patterns\\n- Design consensus mechanisms resistant to manipulation\\n\\n### 4. Goal and Planning Subversion\\n\\nAutonomous agents operate based on goals and planning algorithms, which creates unique vulnerabilities.\\n\\n**Key Threats:**\\n- **Goal Injection**: Subtly altering the agent\'s understanding of its objectives\\n- **Planning Poisoning**: Manipulating the agent\'s reasoning about how to achieve goals\\n- **Reward Hacking**: Exploiting the agent\'s optimization process to achieve unintended outcomes\\n\\n**Mitigations:**\\n- Implement explicit goal validation against safety constraints\\n- Create multi-level planning oversight with safety checks\\n- Design robust reward functions resistant to exploitation\\n- Implement circuit breakers that halt execution when unexpected plans emerge\\n\\n## Implementing Threat Modeling for Agentic AI\\n\\nThe OWASP report recommends a structured approach to threat modeling for autonomous AI systems:\\n\\n### 1. Define the Agent Boundary\\n\\nClearly document:\\n- What capabilities and tools the agent can access\\n- What data the agent can read and modify\\n- What actions the agent can take autonomously vs. requiring approval\\n- How the agent interacts with users, systems, and other agents\\n\\n### 2. Map the Attack Surface\\n\\nIdentify all potential entry points:\\n- User inputs and instructions\\n- External data sources\\n- Tool and API integrations\\n- Inter-agent communications\\n- Persistence mechanisms\\n\\n### 3. Identify Threats Using STRIDE-A\\n\\nExtend the traditional STRIDE model with Autonomy considerations:\\n- **Spoofing**: Can attackers impersonate users or other agents?\\n- **Tampering**: Can attackers modify the agent\'s memory or context?\\n- **Repudiation**: Can attackers deny actions taken by the agent?\\n- **Information Disclosure**: Can attackers extract sensitive information?\\n- **Denial of Service**: Can attackers disrupt the agent\'s functioning?\\n- **Elevation of Privilege**: Can attackers gain unauthorized capabilities?\\n- **Autonomy Subversion**: Can attackers manipulate the agent\'s goals or planning?\\n\\n### 4. Implement Defense in Depth\\n\\nCreate multiple layers of protection:\\n- **Prevention**: Input validation, tool sandboxing, memory protection\\n- **Detection**: Anomaly monitoring, safety checking, goal validation\\n- **Response**: Circuit breakers, human oversight, rollback mechanisms\\n- **Recovery**: State restoration, incident analysis, continuous improvement\\n\\n## Conclusion: Security by Design for the Age of Autonomous AI\\n\\nAs AI systems gain greater autonomy, security can no longer be an afterthought. The OWASP Agentic AI report provides a crucial framework for understanding and addressing the unique security challenges of autonomous systems.\\n\\nBy implementing structured threat modeling early in the development process, organizations can harness the transformative potential of agentic AI while managing the novel risks these systems introduce. The goal isn\'t to limit innovation but to ensure that autonomous systems operate safely, reliably, and in alignment with human intentions\u2014even in the face of sophisticated attacks."},{"id":"data-governance-playbook","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/data-governance-playbook","source":"@site/blog/2025-05-02-data-governance-playbook.mdx","title":"From Data Chaos to Data Confidence - A Pragmatic Playbook for Self\u2011Sustaining Data Governance","description":"\u2728 What you\'ll learn (tl;dr) In ~8 minutes you\'ll see why most data\u2011governance efforts stall, how to turn governance into load\u2011bearing scaffolding, and the exact roadmap, roles, and rituals that move you from ad\u2011hoc chaos to self\u2011sustaining confidence\u2014without freezing delivery.","date":"2025-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"data governance","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-governance"},{"inline":true,"label":"data management","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-management"},{"inline":true,"label":"data strategy","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-strategy"},{"inline":true,"label":"organizational culture","permalink":"/blog/tags/organizational-culture"}],"readingTime":3.08,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Manu Mishra","title":"Solutions Architect & Applied Software Engineer","url":"https://github.com/manu-mishra","image_url":"/img/logo.png","imageURL":"/img/logo.png","socials":{},"key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"data-governance-playbook","title":"From Data Chaos to Data Confidence - A Pragmatic Playbook for Self\u2011Sustaining Data Governance","authors":{"name":"Manu Mishra","title":"Solutions Architect & Applied Software Engineer","url":"https://github.com/manu-mishra","image_url":"/img/logo.png","imageURL":"/img/logo.png"},"tags":["data governance","data management","data strategy","organizational culture"],"date":"2025-05-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Threat Modeling for Autonomous AI - What OWASP Wants You to Know","permalink":"/blog/threat-modeling-autonomous-ai"},"nextItem":{"title":"Tackling Digital Standstill Through the Theory of Constraints - A New Lens on Technical Debt","permalink":"/blog/digital-standstill-theory-constraints"}},"content":"\u2728 **What you\'ll learn (tl;dr)** In ~8 minutes you\'ll see why most data\u2011governance efforts stall, how to turn governance into load\u2011bearing scaffolding, and the exact roadmap, roles, and rituals that move you from ad\u2011hoc chaos to self\u2011sustaining confidence\u2014without freezing delivery.\\n\\n**Big idea**: Data governance isn\'t red tape; it\'s the scaffolding that lets strategic initiatives\u2014from AI to customer experience\u2014scale safely and evolve fast.

Companies striving to evolve and stay ahead often encounter the phenomenon of a \'Digital Standstill\'\u2014a term referring to the stagnation in innovation and development caused by accumulating technical debt.\\n\\nIn this article, I intend to shed light on how the Theory of Constraints can provide a systematic approach to overcoming the challenge posed by technical debt.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## What is the Theory of Constraints?\\n\\nDeveloped by Dr. Eliyahu Goldratt, the Theory of Constraints (ToC) is a management paradigm that posits a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. In the context of business, the weakest link or \'constraint\' limits the performance of the entire system. The objective of ToC is to identify these constraints and strengthen them to elevate the system\'s overall throughput.\\n\\n## Technical Debt: The Invisible Enemy\\n\\nLike financial debt, technical debt isn\'t inherently evil; it can provide short-term benefits such as faster time-to-market. The problem arises when this debt isn\'t \\"paid off\\" timely through code refactoring, documentation, or other methods to improve code quality. The result? A Digital Standstill, where the accrued debt impedes progress, much like a bottleneck in a manufacturing process.\\n\\n## Technical Debt is Not Evil\\n\\nContrary to popular opinion, technical debt is not always a byproduct of sloppy programming or lax project management. In many cases, it\'s a strategic decision, allowing companies to act more agilely. Technical debt can be compared to taking out a loan to speed up growth\u2014beneficial if managed well. The key is disciplined \'repayment,\' which involves the continuous investment of time and resources in code quality, documentation, and system architecture.\\n\\n## Applying Theory of Constraints to Technical Debt\\n\\nJust as ToC identifies and optimizes the \'constraints\' or \'bottlenecks\' in a process, it can be applied to technical debt management. Here\'s how:\\n\\n### Step 1: Identify the Constraint\\n\\nFind out what elements of your technical debt are holding you back the most. Is it poorly documented code, outdated libraries, or perhaps inefficient algorithms?\\n\\n### Step 2: Exploit the Constraint\\n\\nOnce identified, focus on optimizing this weakest link. Allocate resources to refactor the \'most expensive\' parts of your debt, and make them more manageable.\\n\\n### Step 3: Subordinate All Else to the Constraint\\n\\nRedirect resources from less critical tasks and focus on relieving the identified bottleneck. It might mean pausing new feature development briefly, but the long-term benefits often justify the short-term costs.\\n\\n### Step 4: Elevate the Constraint\\n\\nIf you find that even after exploitation, the constraint is still a bottleneck, look for ways to remove it entirely, perhaps through significant refactoring or even a system overhaul.\\n\\n### Step 5: Repeat\\n\\nOnce a constraint is removed or optimized, a new constraint will typically appear. The process is cyclical, and you must continue to identify new constraints and optimize them.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe Theory of Constraints offers a powerful framework for systematically addressing and mitigating the limitations imposed by technical debt. As businesses strive to innovate and scale, understanding how to manage technical debt becomes increasingly crucial. By employing the Theory of Constraints, companies can effectively prioritize their \'debt repayment\' strategy, thereby escaping the paralyzing grip of a Digital Standstill and paving the way for sustainable growth."},{"id":"three-cs-of-coe","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/three-cs-of-coe","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-27-three-cs-of-coe.mdx","title":"The Three \\"C\\"s of COE - From Center to Centering to Culture of Excellence","description":"Technological realm is always changing, and organizations must constantly navigate through turbulent waves and shifting currents.

The compass guiding many on this voyage has been the Centers of Excellence (COE). But is the COE an eternal beacon, or does it have its sunset?\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The Evolution of Centers of Excellence\\n\\nCenters of Excellence have traditionally been established as centralized hubs of expertise, designed to standardize practices, drive innovation, and ensure quality across an organization. They\'ve been the go-to solution for organizations looking to build competency in specific areas, from technology adoption to process improvement.\\n\\nHowever, as organizations evolve and the pace of technological change accelerates, the traditional COE model is being challenged. The rigid structures and centralized control that once provided stability can now hinder agility and innovation. This has led to a rethinking of the COE concept, moving from a centralized \\"Center\\" to a more distributed \\"Centering\\" approach, and ultimately towards fostering a \\"Culture of Excellence\\" throughout the organization.\\n\\n## The Three \\"C\\"s of COE\\n\\n### 1. Center of Excellence\\n\\nThe traditional Center of Excellence is characterized by:\\n\\n- Centralized expertise and control\\n- Standardized practices and methodologies\\n- Formal governance structures\\n- Focus on quality and consistency\\n\\nThis model works well in stable environments where standardization and control are paramount. However, it can create bottlenecks and slow down innovation in fast-paced, dynamic contexts.\\n\\n### 2. Centering of Excellence\\n\\nAs organizations recognize the limitations of centralized control, many are shifting towards a \\"Centering of Excellence\\" approach:\\n\\n- Distributed expertise with central coordination\\n- Flexible guidelines rather than rigid standards\\n- Collaborative governance\\n- Focus on enablement and support\\n\\nThis model balances the need for consistency with the flexibility required for innovation and agility. It recognizes that excellence can\'t be confined to a single center but must be nurtured throughout the organization.\\n\\n### 3. Culture of Excellence\\n\\nThe ultimate evolution is towards a \\"Culture of Excellence\\" where:\\n\\n- Excellence is embedded in organizational values and behaviors\\n- Everyone is empowered to innovate and improve\\n- Self-governance based on shared principles\\n- Focus on continuous learning and adaptation\\n\\nIn this model, excellence isn\'t a department or a process\u2014it\'s a mindset that permeates every aspect of the organization.\\n\\n## Making the Transition\\n\\nTransitioning from a Center to a Culture of Excellence doesn\'t happen overnight. It requires:\\n\\n- Leadership commitment to distributed excellence\\n- Investment in building capabilities across the organization\\n- Tolerance for experimentation and learning from failure\\n- Recognition and reward systems that reinforce the desired culture\\n- Continuous communication and reinforcement of shared values\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe journey from Center to Culture represents a fundamental shift in how organizations approach excellence. Rather than relying on a select group of experts to drive quality and innovation, forward-thinking organizations are recognizing that true excellence comes from creating an environment where everyone is empowered to contribute their best.\\n\\nAs you consider your organization\'s approach to excellence, ask yourself: Are we building a Center, or are we cultivating a Culture? The answer may determine your ability to navigate the ever-changing technological landscape successfully."},{"id":"priming-business-flywheel-genai","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/priming-business-flywheel-genai","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-31-priming-business-flywheel-genai.mdx","title":"Priming Business Flywheel with Gen-AI","description":"Achieving sustained growth is the ultimate dream for many businesses, but how to realize that dream is often elusive.
