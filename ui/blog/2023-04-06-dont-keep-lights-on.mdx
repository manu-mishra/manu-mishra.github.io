## Consolidate or Get Consolidated

In 2023, businesses face a choice between consolidating their systems or facing the risk of being consolidated by their competitors. With economic uncertainty and rapid technological change, companies must stay agile and adaptable to stay ahead of the competition. However, many businesses are held back by legacy systems and processes that are no longer efficient or effective.

## The Cost of Keeping the Lights On

Maintaining outdated products and services that don't generate revenue can drain a business's finances and resources. Legacy systems often require more maintenance and support, which can divert resources away from more profitable areas of the business. Additionally, businesses that fail to adapt to changing customer needs and preferences risk losing market share to more nimble competitors.

## The Benefits of Deprecating Legacy Systems

Deprecating legacy systems can bring a range of benefits to businesses. Businesses can lower their maintenance costs and increase efficiency by reducing the number of systems and processes that need support. Legacy systems often require specialized knowledge to maintain, which can be a bottleneck regarding resourcing. By reducing the number of systems to support, businesses can free up resources to focus on more important tasks.

Moreover, deprecating legacy systems can also improve customer satisfaction. Outdated systems can be slow and unreliable, leading to frustration among customers who are used to faster, more intuitive experiences. By upgrading to newer, more streamlined systems, businesses can provide a better customer experience and build loyalty.

## Investing in Customers for Long-Term Success

One way to reduce the need for old duplicate systems is to invest in customers to help them migrate to newer services. This can be done through targeted marketing campaigns, personalized support, and incentives to upgrade. By making it easier for customers to switch to newer services, businesses can reduce the need to maintain outdated systems and processes.

For example, Adobe successfully transitioned from selling boxed software to a cloud-based subscription model by investing in customer education and support. By offering tutorials, webinars, and personalized support, Adobe was able to help its customers migrate to the new system smoothly. The result was a more efficient and profitable business model that better met customer needs.

## Conclusion

- Assess your current systems and processes to identify legacy systems that are no longer efficient or effective.
- Consider deprecating legacy systems to lower maintenance costs, increase efficiency, and improve customer satisfaction.
- Invest in customer education and support to help them migrate to newer services and reduce the need to maintain outdated systems and processes.
- Reinvest resources into more profitable business areas by shedding outdated offerings and focusing on core areas.
