title: Software Craftsmanship - Objectify Tools, Not Debates
description: Why endless debates about microservices vs monoliths, serverless vs servers miss the point. Learn to treat software tools objectively and focus on craftsmanship over dogma in engineering decisions.

The debates from 2015 are back. 

Microservices v/s Monolith.  
Server v/s serverless.  
Stateless v/s Stateful  
No-SQL v/s SQL  
Screwdriver v/s Hammer  
Bread v/s Cake  

These arguments have become the equivalent of a wrestling match in the software engineering world, where the last man standing gets the privilege to write code his way. And, of course, we all know that the only way to code is their way, right?

While we're engrossed in these seemingly infinite debates, guess what we're not doing? You've nailed it. We're not paying attention to the real craftsmanship of software engineering. Who cares about creating effective, sustainable, and scalable software solutions when we can spend our time arguing about whether or not to use microservices?

## The Distraction of Debate

We the engineers, the creators of the digital world, spending our valuable time debating about the tools we use, rather than focusing on the craft itself. Let's not forget that in our fast-paced technical industry, distractions are plentiful. There will always be a new trend, a new tool, a new buzzword vying for our attention. The media, with its endless cycle of hype and controversy, can often amplify these distractions, leading us away from the core of our craft.

## The Art of Objectifying Tools

Tools are important. They make our job easier. But, they are just that - tools. They are means to an end, not the end itself. If we can remember this simple truth, maybe we can get back to the real craftsmanship of software engineering. What I mean is that we need to view them as objects that help us achieve our goals, rather than subjects of intense debate and fanatical loyalty. 

## The Real Value of Craftsmanship

While we're locked in our circular debates, the digital world is moving, coding is happening, applications are being developed, and users are either benefiting or suffering. It's time we reclaim the attention that our craft deserves and innovate for the betterment of our users.

Remember, it's not about whether we opted for a monolith or microservices, but how effectively we used our chosen tools to deliver a high-quality product. That's the essence of our craft. That's where the real value of our work lies.

As engineers, we are the pioneers of the digital frontier. It's our innovations that push the boundaries of what's possible. It's our craft that brings concepts to life, that turns lines of code into transformative digital experiences.

## Call to Action

So here's a gentle reminder to step back from the hype, to quiet the noise, and to focus on what truly matters. Let's put the debates aside, pick up our tools, and get back to our craft. Let's create software that's efficient, scalable, and maintainable. Let's write code that's readable and understandable.

In short, let's get back to the real work of software engineering. Let's create, innovate, and push the boundaries of what's possible. Trust me, your end users, and indeed the world, will thank you for it.
